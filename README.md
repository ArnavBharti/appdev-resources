Resources for mobile application development

## Code Editors and IDEs

To program mobile apps you can either use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a text editor combined with iOS/Android's SDK and Command-Line Tools. Most app developers use IDE for programming - XCode for iOS/iPadOS and Android Studio for Android apps. You can also use Visual Studio Code, a text editor, to code. **For beginners I would prefer to use an IDE because they have all the tools built-in**. If you have a lower specs on your device you can use Visual Studio Code as your primary coding environment.

### Android Studio Installation

## Git and GitHub

### Git
Git isÂ free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

### GitHub
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. There are alternatives to GitHub also like GitLab but GitHub is the most popular one. Itâ€™s also the site you will be opening the most. (unless you have a life ðŸ˜œ)

- Learning Git and GitHub is a crucial skill for any developer. However do not get too inimidated by it at an initial stage. Start slowly by learning the basics and you will get better at it.
- This is an awesome resource for learning about these two technologies: [Learn Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics). Practicing what is taught here will take you to an intermediate level enough for most tasks.
