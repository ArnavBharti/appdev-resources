# App Dev Resources

Let's look at the major development verticals you might try out to begin with.

- Mobile App
- Front-End
- Back-End

Now, let's look at what learning any of these verticals majorly makes you capable of.

- If you become an App Developer (I did), you'll be capable of making applications that people may use on their Android/iOS devices, which essentially means being able to code the client-side experience of any application. Once you delve in deeper, you'll meet the Back-End side and use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that they create that you would be fetching and/or posting data from/to.
- If you choose the Front-End path, you're doing almost the same things as your App Dev peers, but not really. As a Front-End developer, you're responsible for the client-side experience of any website that you create. You code how your website looks and how it responds to specific events. Once you're capable enough for that, you meet your Back-End peers as well.
- Option 3, you want to be the Back-End, App Dev and Front-End are nothing without. Back-End, I'd say is the most interesting part of Dev work since you deal with the brain of any application, and the APIs you create are the skeleton for the entire project's working.

If the above descriptions helped you gain even a bit of bias for one of these verticals over the other one, I'd say go forth with your instinct and try it out until you're sure of whether you wish to stick with it or cross it off the list. If your choice was not App Dev, I'm afraid this is as helpful as I can be to you.

## Code Editors and IDEs

To program mobile apps you can either use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a text editor combined with iOS/Android's SDK and Command-Line Tools. Most app developers use IDE for programming - XCode for iOS/iPadOS and Android Studio for Android apps. You can also use Visual Studio Code, a text editor, to code. **For beginners I would prefer to use an IDE because they have all the tools built-in**. If you have a lower specs on your device you can use Visual Studio Code as your primary coding environment.

### Android Studio Installation

- **You should install this regardless if you are on MacOS, Windows or Linux.**
- You will need Android SDK, Android Command-Line Tools, and Android Emulator.
- Below is the installation guidelines.

### XCode Installation

**You can only install XCode on MacOS**

## Git and GitHub

### Git
Git isÂ free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

### GitHub
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. There are alternatives to GitHub also like GitLab but GitHub is the most popular one. Itâ€™s also the site you will be opening the most. (unless you have a life ðŸ˜œ)

- Learning Git and GitHub is a crucial skill for any developer. However do not get too inimidated by it at an initial stage. Start slowly by learning the basics and you will get better at it.
- This is an awesome resource for learning about these two technologies: [Learn Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics). Practicing what is taught here will take you to an intermediate level enough for most tasks.
- [GitHub Website](www.github.com) [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en).
- [Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) [A book on Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
- Here's another for [Git](https://ohshitgit.com/).

## Cross-Platform

### Flutter by Google

- [Flutter Setup Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Follow this guide to completely setup your device for coding in Flutter.
- [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) is one of the best of any mobile tech stacks. Refer to this often especially [Cookbooks](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook), which tell you step-by-step how to do common tasks in Flutter and [CodeLabs](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs), which is an interactive tutorial of Flutter.
- [Dart](www.dart.dev) is the programming language used to code using Flutter framework.

#### Tutorials and Courses

- [Angela Yu](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1-8eTGdQfpj5xq6C272qur0KWoDrQ6RzQ)'s course on Flutter is one of the best courses for learning Flutter and Dart.
- [Vandad Nahivakapoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfUjHNODRoM&list=PL6yRaaP0WPkVtoeNIGqILtRAgd3h2CNpT)'s course is also an excellent deep dive into Flutter. Personally, this is the course I took to learn Flutter along with [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).
